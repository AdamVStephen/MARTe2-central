# MARTe2 Distributions

MARTe2 is designed for portability to many platforms, and extensibility with a rich and diverse ecosystem of supporting environments.

## Baseline References

The minimum viable MARTe2 system comprises a supporting runtime (typically a real-time Linux) and at least for 
development, a toolchain that can build the MARTe2 and MARTe2-components repositories.
