 Core Distribution

The canonical core for a MARTe2 system is to have MARTe2 (by convention cloned as MARTe2-dev) and MARTe2-components.
In addition to these, site/project specific applications may add further elements.

The definitive official source is F4E and the ITER packages delivered for CODAC core system.  The F4E RO, Andre Neto mirrors the F4E internal git repositories on his personal github space.  A number of other MARTe developers have made personal forks from here.

The definitive official UKAEA source is currently tracking the F4E version, but reserves the right to vary since F4E place very tight quality assurance requirements on code that makes it into the core.
